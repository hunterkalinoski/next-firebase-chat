- Create firestore document when new auth is created which contains user data

- In root layout, fetch user document on authstate changed, currently it is placeholder hard coded data

? autocomplete on an input puts weird light gray background on the corners of the input
only happens on rounded inputs
?? no idea why, but would like to remove this
